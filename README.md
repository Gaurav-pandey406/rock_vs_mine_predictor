# Rock vs Mine Classifier

## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts whether an object is a *rock* or a *mine* based on given features. The model is trained using Python and various ML libraries.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset with sonar signal readings to distinguish between rocks and mines. The dataset contains numerical attributes representing sonar signal properties.

## Libraries Used
- pandas - For data handling and preprocessing
- numpy - For numerical computations
- matplotlib & seaborn - For data visualization
- sklearn - For model training and evaluation

## Steps Involved
1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Load dataset using Pandas  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  
   - Normalize or scale features  

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualize class distribution  
   - Analyze feature correlations  

3. *Model Selection & Training*  
   - Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or SVM  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train models and tune hyperparameters  

4. *Evaluation*  
   - Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Plot confusion matrix for better understanding  

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of *[80]%* on the test dataset, successfully classifying rocks and mines.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
